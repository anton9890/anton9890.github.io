abstract: >-
  Silicon oxide thin films have been deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition in SiH4 and N2O plasma along the variation of the gas flow ratio. Optical emission spectroscopy was employed to monitor the plasma and ellipsometry was employed to obtain refractive index of the deposited thin film. The atomic ratio of Si, O, and N in the film was obtained using XPS depth profiling. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy was used to analyze structures of the films. RI decreased with the increase in N2O/SiH4 gas flow ratio. We noticed the increase in the Si-O-Si bond angles as the N2O/SiH4 gas flow ratio increased, according to the analysis of the Si-O-Si stretching peak between 950 and 1,150 cm-1 in the wavenumber. We observed a correlation between the optical emission intensity ratio of (ISi+ISiH)/IO. The OES intensity ratio is also related with the measured refractive index and chemical composition ratio of the deposited thin film. Therefore, we report the added value of OES data analysis from the plasma related to the thin film characteristics in the PECVD process.
